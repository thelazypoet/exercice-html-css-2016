A Beginner’s Guide to Website Speed Optimization

Website performance 
optimization, the focal point of technologically superior website 
designs is the primary factor dictating success for modern online 
businesses. After all, unimpressive website performance kills business 
bottom line when the torture of waiting for slow Web pages to load 
frustrates visitors into seeking alternatives – impatience is a digital 
virtue!

		    		And speed sells!
		    		We created the following six chapter 
in-depth speed optimization guide to show you how important it is to 
have a fast loading, snappy website! Countless research papers and 
benchmarks prove that optimizing your sites' speed is one of the most 
affordable and highest ROI providing investments!
		    		In the following guide we'll try to 
explain the technical details while at the same time provide you with 
easy to follow instructions that you can start implementing right away! 
We hope you'll find it valuable (and perhaps share-worthy! :) ).
		    		Lightning-fast page load speed 
amplifies visitor engagement, retention, and boosts sales. Instantaneous
 website response leads to maximum conversion rates, and every 1 second 
delay in page load decreases customer satisfaction by 16 percent, page 
views by 11 percent and conversion rates by 7 percent according to a 
recent ((lien: "Aberdeen Group research" vers: http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/)).

	    				Introduction to Website Speed Optimization
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			But What Exactly is Page Speed?
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
		    		The term essentially refers to 
the speed with which Web pages or media content is downloaded from 
website hosting servers and displayed onto the requesting Web browser. 
Page load time is the duration between clicking the link and displaying 
the entire content from the Web page on the requesting browser.
		    		There are three core aspects necessary to understand page speed in context of user experience and website performance:
		    		
		    			- The view of time taken in delivering the requested material along with the accompanying HTML content to the browser.
		    			- Browser response to page load requests.
		    			- The view of end-users as the requested web page renders on 
the browser – this is the ultimate empirical measure of page load speed.
		    		
		    		Website performance subsequently impacts search engine 
rankings developed under proprietary and undisclosed algorithms, 
incorporating key factors including page speed, user experience, website
 responsiveness and a whole lot of other website performance metrics.
		    		The absolute critical principle in 
maximizing website performance is to focus on page speed optimization 
from the ground up. Performance optimization plugins, server side 
scripts and final tweaks have minimal – however noticeable – impact on 
page speed and load times. Yet, Web developers and online business 
owners tend to overlook page load times in their website development and
 design strategies.

	    			Slow? How Slow?
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			Anything slower than the blink of an eye – ((lien: "400 milliseconds" vers: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all)).
 Engineers at Google have discovered that the barely perceptible page 
load time 0.4 seconds is long enough to cause users to search less. 
	    			The technology has come a long way in 
improving internet experience. The over-crowded cyberworld of the 1990s 
was often labeled as the World Wide Wait, but innovations in 
communication and networking technologies have revolutionized the way 
digital information is transmitted across the internet. The next 
generation of online businesses have all the resources they need to 
deliver content instantaneously, but to leverage and complement these 
resources, businesses need speed-optimized websites that deliver the 
best user experience.
	    		
	    		
	    			iMicrosoft
 speed specialist and computer scientist Harry Shum believes 0.25 
seconds of difference in page load time – faster or slower – is the 
magic number dictating competitive advantages for online businesses.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			And what happens when they don’t?
	    			((lien: "1 in 4 visitors" vers: http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/))
 would abandon the website if it takes more than 4 seconds to load. 46 
percent of users don’t revisit poorly performing websites. Website 
owners have mere 5 seconds to engage visitors before they consider 
leaving. 74 percent of users accessing the mobile site would leave if it
 takes longer than 5 seconds to load. Every one-second delay in page 
load time could lead to ((lien: "$1.6 billion in annual losses" vers: http://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales)) for online merchants as big as Amazon.
		    	
		    	
		    		((image: optimization_fichiers/hourglass.png))
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			((lien: "47 percent" vers: http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/))
 of ecommerce customers expect page load times of less than two seconds 
before they consider leaving – 40 percent of users would abandon the 
site at the third second of waiting, before a performance analytics tool
 even captures their presence on the site. The average peak load time 
for conversions is mere 2 seconds – faster than millions of websites out
 there.
	    			And what happens when they speed up?
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			
		    			((image: optimization_fichiers/clock.png))
		    			
		    				When Mozilla increased page speed by 2.2 seconds, Firefox download figures rose by 15.4 percent, or ((lien: "10 million per year" vers: http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/))! Walmart ((lien: "saw 2 percent increase in conversion rates for every 1 second" vers: http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2014/03/21/5-reasons-visitors-leave-your-website.aspx)) improvement in page load times. The numbers don’t lie!
			    		
			    	
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			Acceptable Website Performance – The Neuroscience and Rhythm
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			100 milliseconds. That’s how long the Occipital lobe in our brain stores visual information as a Sensory memory.
	    			Google researchers suggest page load 
times of less than 100 milliseconds give visitors the illusion of 
instantaneous website response as the visual Sensory memory processor in
 our brain works in bursts of 100 milliseconds. The memory store clears 
itself after 0.1 seconds as photoreceptor cells in the eyes transmit 
more information to the Occipital lobe.
	    		
	    		((image: optimization_fichiers/eye_see.png))
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			1 second of page load time does suffice
 in maintaining seamless flow of thought – users feel in control of 
their Web browsing activities, and the mental stress is not aggravated 
unless the website fails to respond as desired.
	    			At 10 seconds of delay, visitor 
attention is barely kept. The sensation of impatience, frustration and 
feeling of abandonment is usually strong enough to keep visitors from 
revisiting such slow websites again.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			The Pragmatic Psychological Conundrum
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			However, abandoning a website due to slow page speed is not 
always the quickest path to access the desired information on the Web. 
An average user would spend several extra minutes browsing 
fast-responding but irrelevant websites, instead of waiting a few more 
seconds for sluggish relevant websites to respond.
	    			And considering the sea of resources on
 the Web, users eventually find the required information on some website
 or the other. But the eventual losers are online businesses unable to 
reach their online customers fast enough, despite hosting the exact 
information and services being sought.
	    			Strange enough, visitors would rather 
spend excessive time browsing for the information elsewhere than waiting
 a few seconds for the right website to load. The experience is similar 
to the ((lien: "Houston airport incident" vers: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html)) from a few years back that led to a clever solution.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/airport.jpg))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Passengers at the airport had to take a 1 minute walk to the 
baggage claim and waited there for 7 minutes to receive their bags. The 
customer relations center was ultimately inundated with complaints for 
the slow service.
	    			So the airport executives came up with a
 cunning solution to "resolve’ the issue. They moved the arrival gates 
far away and routed the luggage to the outermost carousel.
	    			Passengers now had to take a 6 minute walk to the baggage claim area where they received their luggage within 2 minutes.
	    			The result? Zero complaints. Absolutely no passenger left unsatisfied – except with some tired legs.
	    			Similarly, elevators contain mirrors so
 the passengers keep busy in styling themselves and not thinking about 
the time spent travelling.
	    			This passenger behavior is analogous to
 that of website visitors in the cyberworld. And the same general 
principle applies for online businesses as well: It is the objective 
length of wait that defines the experience of waiting.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Now, online businesses can play with human psychology like 
the Houston airport executives and speed up evolution, but with 
virtually no specific formula to make website response times bearable 
for every individual visitor out there. Or they can actually reduce the 
objective length of wait in delivering the requested content to their 
online visitors with a fast responding website – whichever is possible 
when the website is designed to deliver instantaneous response and high 
quality, seamless user experience.
	    			This guide will focus on the latter 
practice, and will actually help you maximize the potential of your 
online business by optimizing website performance and thereby enhancing 
customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty.

	    			Performance Impacts Sales
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			Website performance is user 
experience – the power of page speed, translating into attractive online
 shopping experience inspires sales figures and eventually determines 
online business success. The industry kingpin Google began factoring 
page speed into its proprietary search algorithms ever since it 
experienced the compelling repercussions of website performance lapses 
impacting sales. The search engine giant once experienced a ((lien: "20 percent slump" vers: http://www.montparnas.com/articles/more-evidence-that-speed-is-key-to-user-experience/)) in traffic resulting from half a second delay in page load times.
	    			While Google was quick to resolve the 
issue that barely crippled its market share, the same is not always the 
case with online businesses yet to establish their presence in the 
competitive online marketplace.
					
						So how does website performance affects sales for an average online business?
						Dramatically, is the only answer!
					
					Forrester consulting firm recently studied
 the state of consumer online shopping expectations and evaluated how 
underperforming websites kill business bottom line whereas high-level 
website performance rapidly boosts sales.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			((lien: "The research finds" vers: http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/))
 88 percent of internet users choose online retailers delivering 
high-performance and user-friendly website experience, and almost 50 
percent abandon websites that fail to load within 3 seconds.
	    			These actions consequently impact 
sales. 79 percent of dissatisfied customers no longer revisit 
underperforming websites – except when you’re Google or Amazon. 46 
percent of dissatisfied customers develop a lasting negative impression 
and 44 percent share their shopping experiences with the rest of the 
world. The implications go well beyond the cyber world as 87 percent of 
costumers shop in online as well as brick-and-mortar retail stores.
				
				
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/exit.png))
	    		
			
			
	    		
	    			While service and product quality 
apparently has the biggest impact on business sales, converting website 
visitors into purchasing customers in the cyber world largely depends on
 developing a positive customer impression. And this is where ecommerce 
website performance parameters such as ultra-fast page speed and rapid 
check-out processes come into play, ultimately giving customers a 
positive psychological impression encouraging sales and customer 
loyalty.
	    		
	    	
			
	    		
	    			Performance Impacts Conversion
		    	
		    
		    
	    		
	    			As the most important and powerful internet metric for online
 businesses, conversion rates holistically depend on website KPIs in 
establishing competitive advantages for online retail platforms. 
	    		
	    	
		    
	    		
	    			In the cyber world, traditional 
marketing campaigns alone do not boost conversion rates without 
improvements in website user experience – comprising of page speed and 
website responsiveness.
	    			Obama’s fundraising campaign during the 2011 Presidential Elections raised an ((lien: "additional $34 million" vers: http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/))
 when the Obama for America website shrunk page load time from 5 seconds
 to 2 seconds – that’s 14 percent increase in donation conversion with 
mere 3 seconds of website performance improvement!
	    			Bringing potential customers to the 
doorstep of brick-and-mortar retail stores often requires a thoroughly 
planned marketing and advertisement campaign. And once customers enter 
the shop, they usually don’t leave without a purchase.
	    		
	    		
					((image: optimization_fichiers/whitehouse.jpg))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			It takes far less efforts in bringing 
online customers to visit an online retail store – internet users don’t 
mind a few wayward clicks to open the Web pages they’ve never visited 
before. Search engine optimization and social media adverts often do the
 trick.
	    			Equally convenient for visitors is to 
leave the site if the required information is not made available within a
 bearable few seconds – for unimpressed visitors, that doesn’t take a 
lot more than a few wayward clicks either!
	    			User experience in terms of website 
performance and responsiveness therefore becomes the ultimate factor 
impacting conversion rates in online marketplaces. Ecommerce is first 
and foremost all about customer convenience and reaching potential 
customers efficiently with the right information, products and services 
at the right time.
	    			Neither of which is possible without page speeds faster than users abandoning visits due to website performance concerns.
	    			Not aware about your website performance impacting conversion rates? Tools like the ((lien: "Conversion Loss Calculator" vers: http://www.tagman.com/conversion-loss-calculator/)) might well have the answer.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Performance Impacts User Engagement
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			User engagement statistics feed the cauldron of website 
analytics in developing best strategies to optimize online sales. Online
 businesses established in the competitive cyberspace well understand 
the importance of website performance and tools that analyze and predict
 next-best actions correlating page speed and revenue.
	    			Enhanced user engagement information 
with responsive and fast-loading websites is often seen as a proxy of 
online business success. User engagement is highly dependent upon human 
limitations in storing short-term memory beyond a few seconds, and human
 aspirations of feeling in control over the machine under all 
circumstances.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/website_low.png))
	    		
	    		
	    			For underperforming websites – notice underperformance being a
 relative term – page load times exceed human limitations, whereas 
failure to process user requests gives the false impression of ignorance
 or incompetence in delivering the desired response efficiently and 
accurately.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/website_high.png))
	    		
	    		
	    			High-performing websites on the other hand – notice 
high-performing being a relative term as well – impact three parameters 
that determine user engagement: user feelings, user mental states and 
user interactions. These three aspects create an emotional, cognitive 
and behavioral connection between human visitors (can’t say much about 
bots!) and the website.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			With this connection in place, online businesses can exploit 
user engagement characters such as focused attention, motivation and 
trust in converting visitors into customers, repeat customers and even 
brand ambassadors generating leads across the social media and outside 
of the internet world.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Performance Impacts OpEx and Revenue
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			While investing in website performance optimization adds to 
the CapEx in favor of shaving off a few seconds in page load times, the 
return is inevitably seen in the shape of rising revenues and shrinking 
operational cost and hardware investments.
	    			Ecommerce giant Shopzilla saw ((lien: "50 percent reduction" vers: http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/07/velocity-making-your-site-fast.html))
 in its operational budget by shrinking page load times from 7 seconds 
to 2 seconds. Performance improvements with a website design overhaul 
enabled the company to utilize the same hardware resources to 
efficiently in processing the same amount of website user requests. The 
improved website responsiveness also increased revenues by 12 percent as
 the retail store accommodated expanding Web traffic without prompting 
additional investments in consequently expanding hardware resources.
	    			Improvements in website KPI also lead 
to better AdWords Quality Score and therefore reduce the Cost per Click 
(CPC). Online businesses with high Quality Score and page speed are able
 to spend advertisement budged efficiently and effectively, thereby 
maximizing reach and attracting customers without necessitating 
additional OpEx.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			
	    				
		    				
		    				
		    				
		    				
		    				
		    			
					
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			A slowdown on the other hand minimizes resource utilization. 
Bing conducted an independent study on its website performance affecting
 revenue and found a 2 seconds delay in delivering search query incurred
 revenue loss of 4.3 percent per user.
	    			And customer behavior doesn’t alter 
drastically when the delays are removed. When Google removed a delay of 
0.4 seconds in providing search results, users still made ((lien: "0.21 percent fewer" vers: http://www.fastcompany.com/1769621/googles-new-page-speed-service-promises-boost-sites-ad-revenue-you-can-test-it-too)) searches even with the Web page performing optimally.
	    			Additional efforts in enhancing website
 performance may stretch CapEx temporarily, but the tradeoff is 
ultimately justified as the extra investments translate into higher 
bottom line, increased revenue streams and minimum operational expenses.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Performance Impacts Usability
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Websites with the steepest learning curve achieve the highest
 customer lock-in.  Internet users consider the time taken in learning 
to use alternate websites as a significant switching cost, which acts as
 a mechanism to lock them in to online services offered via 
high-performance websites.
	    			The relationship elements between 
website usability and customer loyalty are tied down to website KPIs, 
including page speed, load time and website responsiveness to user 
requests. A hypothetical model of website speed optimization puts these 
elements into consideration, with characteristics such as Site Trust, 
Interactivity and Information relevance considered as a subset of 
website usability by end-users.
	    			Similarly, Web crawlers and search 
engines measure website performance in terms of page speed, 
navigability, user experience, responsiveness and reachability to global
 audience as a subset of Search Engine Optimization impacting search 
rankings.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			End-users expect the following traits affecting usability of websites:
						
							- Easy to operate, navigate and understand.
							- Directly deliver relevant information and controls being sought.
							- Accessible across all device form factors, machines, operating systems, browsers and geographic locations.
							- Delivering legitimate, credible and high-quality information, products and services with minimal clicks and browser requests.
						
					Fulfilling these intents is vital to maximizing Website 
performance, Usability and Customer Loyalty, all of which are the 
overlapping elements of the single system that works as a channel to 
online business success.

	    			Mobile is the future of 
everything wired. Adoption is skyrocketing as the mobile device 
onslaught looks to encompass the entire human race – ((lien: "1.75 billion smartphone subscriptions" vers: http://www.dazeinfo.com/2014/01/23/smartphone-users-growth-mobile-internet-2014-2017/)),
 around one-fifth of the global population in 2014. And the booming 
tides of stimulating repercussions continue to disturb online businesses
 barely making inroads into the mobile internet marketing segment.
	    			Success in the cyberworld depends on 
the ability to embrace a mobile-first approach in reaching the exploding
 population of mobile subscribers. And for organizations pushing to 
reach the massive mobile population effectively, the unimaginable awards
 emerge just around the corner.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/responsive.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Desktop internet marketing on the other hand is last 
decade-ish. Google the terms “Post PC Era”, “freefall of PC sales” and 
the “death of desktop machines”, and what returns is a myriad of 
journalistic fodder portraying a bleak future for organizations still 
lingering around the desktop internet user-base only.
	    			For such industry laggards, it’s not 
too late to embrace a mobile-first strategy, yet. However, this approach
 doesn’t always pay off for forward-looking online businesses either 
when they fail to optimize their reach to a mobile user-base. That’s not
 as much for taking a false direction in going mobile than missing a few
 vital steps and not filling the void in reaching mobile customers 
efficiently and effectively.
	    			These gaps center on the lack of responsive and high performing mobile websites.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Mobile vs. Desktop – Why does it Matter?
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Because everyone else is doing it, to start with. Competition for the mobile space is intense and Yahoo CEO labels 2014 as the ((lien: "“tipping point”" vers: http://www.cnbc.com/id/101353869)) for the internet. Previously, 2013 was hailed as the ((lien: "‘year of responsive Web design’" vers: http://mashable.com/2012/12/11/responsive-web-design/))
 by industry analysts now anticipating mobile is already pushing desktop
 into the twilight zone. Here are a few quick statistics:
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    				
	    					- 87%of U.S. citizens own mobile devices.((image: optimization_fichiers/stat_us.png))
							- 45%of these own smartphones.((image: optimization_fichiers/stat_smartphone.png))
							- 90%of these go online via mobile.((image: optimization_fichiers/stat_browser.png))
							- These mobile users average1.4 hoursof mobile internet browsing every day.((image: optimization_fichiers/stat_timer.png))
							- 74%would abandon mobile websites that don’t load within 5 seconds.((image: optimization_fichiers/stat_door.png))
	    				
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			The entire focus should lie on treating the two entities – 
mobile and desktop – separately, at least from a website design 
standpoint. Without this strategy, mobile user experience in accessing 
desktop versions of websites is usually compromised in terms of page 
load times, usability and functionality. Compromising these core aspects
 of mobile websites can force online businesses into facing the obvious 
negative implications including:
	    				
	    					- Low Mobile Purchases: Mobile internet shoppers have shorter attention span and lower patience than desktop internet users.
	    					- Losing Competition: According to a survey
 of over a thousand U.S. adult smartphone users, almost 75 percent of 
the respondents said they prefer revisiting mobile ecommerce sites that 
deliver high-end mobile user experience.
	    					- Losing Brand Value: Poorly designed 
mobile websites that simply shrink the HTML of full desktop website 
version for visitors to zoom in and out in navigating through mobile Web
 pages makes users less likely to engage with the company in the future.
	    				
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			These consequences negate the following primary objectives of reaching customers via mobile internet:
	    				
	    					- Expanding customer-base.
							- New advertisement options.
							- Offering quality services efficiently at user convenience.
							- And most concerning, the inevitability in productively embracing mobile web for business development.
	    				
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Desktop and mobile differ in technology resources, form 
factor and user interface – all aspects governing website performance 
optimization implementations. Without optimizing mobile websites 
separately to deliver the best mobile website performance, several 
website KPIs degrade and negatively impact mobile user-experience.
					And since mobile technologies give users 
the ability to search the Web on-the-go, while standing, walking or even
 lying comfortably on the couch, the hunger to feel in control of 
website operations drives user expectations beyond conventional 
standards applicable only in the desktop arena. The ability to deliver 
mobile website content within this short attention span of around 2 
seconds makes all the difference in winning customer loyalty and 
long-term business relationship with mobile internet users.

	    			High Performance Mobile Website and the Competitive Space of High Conversions
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Considering the high volume internet traffic using mobile 
devices for ecommerce purchases, high-performing mobile websites is an 
evident priority for ecommerce organizations. A ((lien: "recent research study reveals" vers: http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2347596/pcs-tablets-and-mobile-phones-each-play-a-different-role-in-local-search))
 ecommerce businesses could miss out on millions of mobile shoppers with
 the potential aggregate revenue per conversion of mobile shoppers 
averaging around 80 percent of the same among desktop users purchasing 
online.
	    			The conversion rate among small 
ecommerce businesses operating on low-performance mobile websites is 
typically 0.6 percent in comparison with the 1.6 percent conversion rate
 of desktop ecommerce providers in the same size segment.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Tablet users on the other hand spend 20
 percent more than desktop users. By capturing this audience, online 
businesses making inroads into the mobile internet marketing segment can
 expect high revenue streams that could potentially replace desktop 
audience one day – although that day currently seems to be a bit too far
 into the future.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/tablet_money.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Nevertheless, the demand to satisfy the
 needs of mobile users will continue to rise exponentially. Search 
Engine Optimization of mobile websites is now a separate trade – and so 
is mobile website speed optimization, which constitutes of:
	    				
	    					- High page speed
							- Low page load times
							- Efficient delivery of media-rich content
							- Download speed
							- Optimal site format
							- Easy navigation and usability across the website
							- And a fully functional website requiring minimal user-input in performing otherwise complex task of mobile internet usage.
	    				
	    			By addressing these issues, micro-sites in the mobile 
internet sector can hope to compete with their larger counterparts 
enjoying up to 1.2 percent conversion rates (that’s twice as much as 
desktop-site conversion rates!), and well over 80 percent of revenue per
 conversion achieved with the desktop versions of their sites.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Fastest to the Finish Line Stand Tallest on the Podium
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			It therefore comes to little surprise that Fortune 100 companies ((lien: "average 5 seconds" vers: http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/average-mobile-page-load-time-for-a-fortune-100-company-is-about-5-seconds-37293/)) in page load times for their mobile websites – that’s two seconds faster than the average acceptable standards (7 seconds max).
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/meter.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			For ecommerce merchants however, 5 
seconds of page load time is perhaps sufficient to put visitors off 
toward a faster alternative. And in the retail segment, some websites 
load as fast as Google – page load times as low as 1 second!
	    			Strikingly fast, perhaps a bit 
Google-like focus on page speed and website responsiveness. That 
however, is the average page load time of ((lien: "16 of the top 100" vers: http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/top-100-multichannel-retailers-mobile-sites-16-load-in-less-than-1-second-38068/))
 multichannel retailers reaping the rewards of an insanely-fast mobile 
website and thereby yielding multi-billion dollar revenue figures from 
mobile customers.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Google describes a number of changes (((lien: "here" vers: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/mobile)) and ((lien: "here" vers: https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/mobile)))
 in mobile website design to render Web pages on mobile screens well 
within 1 second – that’s even if you’re not a Fortune 100 company or a 
Top 100 ecommerce retailer!
	    			For those uber-geeks taking mobile Web 
development matters into their own hands, the non-profit World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C) provides a handful of best practices (((lien: "here" vers: http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/)) and ((lien: "here" vers: http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/it/en/wipo_itu_wai_ge_10/wipo_itu_wai_ge_10_ref_a05archer.ppt))). It’s a long read, demonstrating how important and intensive mobile website optimization really is!
	    			And for business owners employing 
Web developers to design highly responsive and speed-optimized mobile 
websites, the improvements should be sought in the following three 
ingredients of mobile website anatomy:
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    				
	    					- Fluid grids
	    					- Flexible images
							- Media queries
	    				
	    			And a design focus on the following mobile website elements:
	    				
	    					- Masterhead
	    					- Image gallery
	    					- Product description
	    					- Auxiliary information
							- Footer
	    				
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Customers appreciate fast responding 
websites and ultra-low page load times. Mobile technology and the 
innovation coming along with increasing reliance on smartphones and 
tablets is showing no signs of slowing down. Top online retailers 
understand the need to deliver website content efficiently from Web 
servers to the tiny real estate of mobile screens. Getting it right with
 thoroughly designed websites dedicated for mobile platforms enables 
customers to make quick and educated purchase decisions that ultimately 
create never-ending revenue streams for online businesses.

	    			((lien: "60 percent" vers: http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2348076/60-of-Consumers-Use-Mobile-Exclusively-to-Make-Purchase-Decisions-Study))
 of consumers use mobile devices exclusively to make quick purchase 
decisions. The number of online visits made with mobile devices has been
 twice as much as those made with desktop computers so far in the year 
2014 – 10.6 billion for mobile versus 5.8 billion for desktop PC! Mobile
 devices and desktop computers or laptops are considered equally 
important as the media source of information – 42 percent of internet 
users favor of mobile as opposed to 43 percent for PC/laptop – but the 
convenience in accessing the Web via mobile devices is driving mobile 
internet usage and business opportunities.
					And if you still plan to overlook mobile 
website performance, you might want to reconsider the opportunities and 
success otherwise achievable mostly with a dedicated, speed-optimized 
mobile website.
	    		
	    	
	    

		
	    	
	    		
	    			
	    				Chapter 4
	    				Common Business Mistakes that Kill Website Performance
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Online marketplaces – like 
battle grounds of the ancient Greeks – are high-stake competitive 
platforms where only the most diligent survive. And as with all 
high-stake battles, human factors (decision errors, blunders and 
ignorance) contribute significantly toward the outcome of online 
business competitions.
	    			Yet, online businesses and webmasters 
responsible for maintaining high-performance and fully-optimized 
websites tend to overlook crucial Web design elements that cripple site 
load times. And the consequences are usually as hazardous as the Trojan 
Horse penetrating through fortified defenses and taking full control 
over the City of Troy, despite the size and dominion of the Trojan Army.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
					Competition for online business success is
 just as intense, if only a bit less violent. The fight for customer 
attention boils down to delivering the requested content most 
efficiently and accurately, irrespective of the company size and past 
laurels. And just like human blunders and ignorance dictating outcome of
 the Trojan War, common mistakes killing website performance tend to 
determine the outcome of online business competition – fastest to the 
finish line wins the race!
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/race.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			The aptly named Gap of Death, the interval between expected page load time of under ((lien: "2 seconds and average site load time of 5 seconds" vers: http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2014/04/09/web-page-speed-affect-conversions-infographic/))
 expands or contracts due to surprisingly neglected website optimization
 tactics and business decisions. Contrary to the popular sentiment, 
speed optimization is ideally implemented across all stages of Website 
development, and not just after building the entire site, which is only 
when website owners realize the need to push for website performance 
optimization.
	    			Final tweaks and speed optimization 
add-ons implemented after developing websites does improve page speed 
though, bringing down load time to at least reach the Gap of Death. But 
even within this performance zone, conversion rates go down by 7 percent
 for each second of delay after the expected page load time of 2 
seconds.
					On the other hand, website owners wary of 
speed optimization tactics can aim for higher website performance by 
avoiding the following deadly mistakes as well:
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Mediocre Web Hosting Service
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			The mistake of opting for a mediocre Web hosting service can live forever. With ((lien: "nearly a billion websites" vers: http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/))
 online, the Web hosting space is both crowded and fractured. Global 
availability of a vast array hosting options is pushing businesses and 
hobbyists to establish their presence in the cyber world. The demand for
 cost-effective Web hosting services is rising exponentially, and 
hosting providers are more than willing to compromise service quality in
 accumulating market share with low-cost tiers.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Mediocre Web hosts selling 
cost-effective services continue to maximize profitability by hosting 
thousands of websites on single instances of bloated Apache stacks. 
Unoptimized servers running thousands of public websites on a single 
server stack is particularly harmful for ecommerce websites 
characterized by uncontrollable web traffic spikes, multimedia content 
and large website files.
	    			Web hosting and development companies 
with a common response to speed optimization concerns that “everyone’s 
got broadband these days” translates directly into financial losses and 
damaged brand reputation for online businesses. Attractive website 
performance is critical to the success of ecommerce businesses since 
websites taking more than 3 seconds to load ((lien: "immediately lose 40 percent" vers: http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/)) of the traffic. 79 percent of dissatisfied visitors almost never return to slow ecommerce sites!
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/machine.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
					Perhaps then, investing time and money in 
pursuing the highest quality Web hosting services is key to maintaining 
high-performance websites generating vast revenue streams by attracting 
visitor attention efficiently and accurately.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Giving Way to Bandwidth Thieves
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Website speed optimization is an ongoing and evolving 
process, and goes well beyond subscribing for the best Web hosting 
services in the world. Some business decisions intended to maximize 
revenue by altering website design and features adversely affect website
 performance by stealing sizeable chunks from the bandwidth allotted to 
each individual visitor.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Too Many Widgets or Plugins
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Additional features and functionality always pleases website 
owners and developers. Widgets and plugins enable convenient changes to 
existing websites along with a slight burden on website performance. 
Even with the smallest of widgets such as the Google+ button, the burden
 to website performance in terms of page load time can increase by as 
much as 2 seconds in some instances.
	    			Keeping add-ons limited to a bare 
minimum is essential to maintaining optimum website performance – even 
plugins installed to the same website core compete in delivering the 
quickest response to browser requests, ultimately draining bandwidth.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/widget.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Sometimes the quality and functionality
 of plugins installed matters far more than the number itself. Plugins 
that query large streams of data to perform complex operations should do
 this off-server, and not within website hosting environments such as 
WordPress.
	    		
	    	

	    	
	    		
	    			Too Many Ads and Affiliate Code
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Tempting as it may seem, selling too much real estate to 
third-party advertisers drastically degrades website performance. Too 
many ads, or slow loading ads drive bounce rates, and negatively impact 
online marketability. The financial losses that come with high bounce 
rates outweigh the monetary benefits of handing over vast website spaces
 to advertisers.
	    			According to one ((lien: "research study" vers: http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/advertising/)),
 the cost of generating revenue with banner advertisement is almost 33 
percent of additional latency. Intrusive pop-up ads further aggravate 
visitors into abandoning websites at even higher rates.
	    			Affiliate code, even just those few 
additional lines of script take up valuable memory space on the hosting 
environment and require additional processing cycles in delivering the 
content to end-users.
					Nevertheless, online advertisement is the 
primary source of income for many online businesses (think Google and 
Facebook!), and an optimal website advertisement model goes a long way 
in increasing website revenue while minimizing the cost of latency and 
page load delays.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Bloated Design Theme and Incompatible Multimedia
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Tempting website design themes and multimedia content are 
head turners for online traffic. That is, if the content even reaches 
the eyes of impatient visitors fast enough. High quality images and 
videos (large pixels, large file size) take longer in downloading onto 
requesting browsers, whereas low quality, lightweight graphics barely 
capture user attention despite their lower load times.
	    			However, graphics intensive content is 
not always the deciding factor in driving conversions and sales. This is
 especially true for ecommerce websites that must contain fast-loading 
product images and videos describing the value of products, and not 
necessarily their visual beauty.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Compatibility issues also affect 
multimedia and application performance for certain browsers and 
geographic locations. Take Google Chrome and Shockwave Flash as an 
example. The two rarely play nicely to each other. Similarly, government
 restrictions can also prevent specific multimedia content from reaching
 local visitors.
	    			Websites with non-functional multimedia
 content takes excessive client-server communication cycles to reach 
requesting browsers, ultimately deteriorating website performance. It is
 however, up to website owners to ensure streamlined service ability 
across all browser platforms, device form factors and geographic 
locations as government policies and browser compatibility potentially 
changes over time, and most often, unpredictability as well.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/content.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Fast loading and fully functional 
multimedia content is necessary for ecommerce merchants to keep hold of 
website visitors. Every second of delay in page load time leads to 
frustrated visitors abandoning slow websites, and drawing along ((lien: "7 percent loss in conversion rates, 11 percent fewer page views and 16 percent decrease in customer satisfaction" vers: http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/)).
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			And a Bit More of that Code – Sign Up Forms and Analytics
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Sign Up forms and analytics code add only a few lines to 
Website core files. But when too many single-lines of code take space on
 the website back-end, Web content assets and plugins with lengthy code 
end up competing for tiny memory spaces in short processing cycles. As a
 result, the popular physics phenomenon of non-linearity kicks in, and 
each component performs unpredictably, usually consuming more processing
 cycles than expected.
	    			From the perspective of end users, 
excessive services are often unnecessary or at most, considered 
secondary to the actual content portrayed by the website. Many website 
hosts more than 80 assets (images, plugins, add-ons and other multimedia
 content), and all of this content is not necessarily delivered to 
requesting browsers as per user preferences. Additional investments in 
developing media-rich websites ultimately backfire when the information 
actually requested to reach end-users is held by irrelevant sign-up 
forms, analytics code and other content adding unnecessary weight to the
 website.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Mobile Mistakes and Misguided Redirects
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Global smartphone subscription is expected to surpass the ((lien: "2 billion mark by 2015" vers: http://www.dazeinfo.com/2014/01/23/smartphone-users-growth-mobile-internet-2014-2017/)),
 when 83 percent of internet users will access the internet via mobile 
devices. 30 percent of ecommerce website traffic in 2013 came from 
mobile, and this number continues to rise exponentially with the 
exploding smartphone user-base.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			
		    			((image: optimization_fichiers/mobile_seconds.png))
		    			
	    				The competition to capture attention of mobile users is even
 more intense due to slow loading mobile websites and lower visitor 
patience levels. ((lien: "60 percent" vers: http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/))
 of mobile users expect mobile websites to load within 3 seconds. And on
 average, 3 in 4 people will abandon a mobile website if it takes any 
longer than 5 seconds to load, whereas an average mobile takes even 
longer periods of 6-10 seconds to load.
	    				
	    				
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Excessive delays in mobile page load 
time occur mostly when websites are not specifically optimized and 
designed to deliver high performance on a mobile device interface. Even 
with dedicated smartphone-optimized pages, mobile users are not always 
redirected to intended mobile-versions of desktop website pages 
requested from mobile browsers.
	    			Redirects are instructions that send 
users seeking one website URL to another one that (supposedly) contains 
the exact information requested by users. Redirects are most effective 
for mobile users searching for desktop versions of website pages that 
must be mapped well to equivalent mobile versions in delivering the best
 mobile website experience.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Doing so inaccurately keeps users from 
switching between unwanted website files until they reach the right one.
 This causes unnecessary delays in loading the information actually 
sought by end-users.
	    			This is analogous to finding an empty 
parking spot in a large, crowded parking lot, and reaching the 
apparently empty space only to find out it’s occupied by a small vehicle
 that wasn’t visible from the distance. The process continues until a 
free space is finally reached – that is, if the driver even continues 
searching for the empty space and isn’t frustrated enough to leave the 
parking lot altogether.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/parking_lot.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Website owners are eventually 
responsible for losing competitive advantages in the mobile space when 
the mobile Web traffic is simply redirected toward irrelevant desktop 
website version, instead of delivering a speed-optimized mobile solution
 for mobile visitors.
	    			Websites not speed-optimized for mobile
 devices suffer from common issues hampering mobile user experience. 
Issues such as faulty redirects, unplayable videos, bloated images and 
graphics, irrelevant cross-linking and unnecessary assets delivered to 
mobile visitors degrade website performance and ultimately drive bounce 
rates.
	    			Only 10 percent of the waiting period 
is defined by the HTML response to browser requests, and the remaining 
90 percent of the delay is caused in rendering pages, parsing HTML, 
executing code scripts and retrieving embedded assets. Website 
performance overhaul with optimization tools and script tweaks can 
scrape off sizeable chunks from page load times, but perhaps not as 
effectively as developing a speed optimized website from scratch. And 
the latter is more of a marketing strategy, a business decision and 
slight awareness in avoiding the most common mistakes that can 
potentially ruin online businesses by killing website performance.

	    				Website Speed Testing – Identify Performance Bottlenecks!
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Web traffic and search engine 
ranking is primarily a vanity metric for website performance. Important 
as they are, neither is more indicative of online business success than 
sales figures and conversion rates. Putting things into perspective, 
ecommerce websites with (almost) zero percent bounce rate, 15 percent 
conversion rates and 10,000 unique website visitors from low search 
engine rankings fare far better than high ranking sites enjoying 100,000
 unique visits with only 0.01 percent conversion rate.
	    			The debate of conversion rate 
optimization can carry on for encyclopedic lengths, and implementing 
business best-practices on Frankensteinish websites can take tons of 
investments with efforts of patient execution spanning across months 
before any significant conversion rate improvement is yielded.
	    			And there’s more to convincing 
impatient citizens of the cyberworld into purchasing online products and
 services than implementing passive business strategies to enhance 
marketability. Online businesses focusing on improving website 
performance experience immediate results in the form of higher 
conversion rates and sky-rocketing sales.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Page speed in particular fills the void
 in enhancing marketability by improving website user experience to keep
 impatient online customers engaged and satisfied. A recent research 
report published by O’Rielly concludes improvements in website end-user 
experience by reducing page load time boost sales and conversion rates 
significantly. The ((lien: "staggering statistics" vers: http://www.atilus.com/website-speed-affect-business/)) are as follows:
						
							- +3%conversions per second with page load time improvement from 15 seconds to 7 seconds.
							- +2%conversions per second with page load time improvement from 7 seconds to 5 seconds.
							- +1%conversions per second with page load time improvement from 4 seconds to 2 seconds.
						
					These statistics only describe how page speed impacts business 
success in the competitive cyberspace. Complicated as it seems, slicing 
off large chunks of page load time from slow loading websites is a 
relatively low-hanging fruit IF speed optimization tactics are 
implemented in the right direction – that’s a huge IF when performance 
bottlenecks are unknown, too complex or simply too vast and diverse to 
identify.
					The pursuit for speed optimized website 
begins with identifying critical front-end issues most apparent under 
standard website performance testing processes. Google’s Head 
Performance ((lien: "Engineer Steve Souders advises" vers: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/02/10/the-performance-golden-rule/)) on this matter, saying “80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the front-end. Start there”.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			What to Test?
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Before the exploration for page speed bumps begins, 
understanding the behavior of the most impactful website speed 
performance indicators helps to accurately identify performance 
loopholes in websites.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Initial Page Speed
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Downloading tons of memory hogging website content within 
milliseconds of initiating browser requests is not entirely possible 
without a thorough revamp and speed optimization of slow websites. In 
many cases, visitors only seek the primary information in the form of 
content or product information portrayed by Web pages. Add a lot of 
complementary graphics and website features, and page rendering times 
rise beyond measure.

	    			Keeping the initial page speed high keeps visitors engaged 
even when the entire website content including bulky graphics take ages 
to render completely. Monitoring high initial page speed by tracking 
parameters such as Time to First Byte (TTFB) or performing Ping requests
 from website servers accurately describe initial page load times and 
page speed statistics. If these take too long, work needs to be done at 
the back-end in the form of server-side and website core optimization.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Full Page Load Time
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    		Monitoring the time consumed in rendering entire page content 
onto requesting browsers is an integral element of end-user website 
experience testing. This information drives strategic IT decisions in 
deploying and optimizing hardware infrastructure to maximize website 
performance.
	    		Regularly monitoring this performance 
indicator enables website owners to realize how the website performs as 
it scales in terms of size and content type. With this information, 
webmasters can cache static content in separate locations such as 
Content Delivery Network (CDN) while maintaining dedicated back-end 
servers to efficiently deliver dynamically-loaded content.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Geographic Performance
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			One of the perks of operating an online business is the 
ever-expanding global market reach. But this reach is not always equally
 efficient – and hence effective – across the globe due to the very 
factors that limit client-server communication. Government policies, 
bandwidth and technology limitations prevent optimum website performance
 around the world, so website speed and availability tests should be 
conducted across disparate locations to determine global website 
performance results impacting world-wide business reach.

	    			Load Tolerance
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Website performance varies with fluctuations in Web traffic. 
Hosting servers handling normal load at peak performance may lose page 
speed under excessive loads. Conducting Stress Tests, Ramp Tests, Load 
Tests and other Performance Tests on websites creates an accurate 
picture of how much Web traffic the website can handle before losing 
performance or going down altogether. Compare the results with the 
website’s actual usage patterns to determine whether the website needs 
hardware upgrades to handle peak load as efficiently as possible.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Web Server CPU Load
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Shared hosting providers running thousands of websites on 
single Apache servers fail to deliver high performance even when the 
website is well-designed with a clean and speed-optimized code. 
Performance issues intensify during peak load times when insufficient 
server compute power fails to process website download requests 
efficiently. Monitoring server CPU load enables hosting companies and IT
 staff running locally hosted websites to keep a check on back-end 
hardware capabilities in handling unpredictable Web traffic deluge.
	    		
	    		
	    			
	    				
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Website Database Performance
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Database performance is critical for websites maintaining 
dynamic content pulled from back-end databases. A mechanism should be in
 place to detect and alert for inaccuracies in data transmission. 
Keeping an eye on free disk space on servers hosting websites locally 
helps avoid errors and data losses that lead to broken links and 
eventually degrade website performance.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			How to Test
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Website owners can leverage an array of free and premium 
website performance testing services to analyze Web pages and generate 
tailored solutions to fill the deepest of performance loopholes 
hampering page speed.

and programmatically generate scores and suggestions to educate 
non-geeky website owners.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			How these tools Work
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			These tools use a bunch of browsers to load websites and 
replicate end-user website experience across disparate geographic 
locations. Performance bottlenecks are monitored across various elements
 of the Web page under scrutiny including file size, load time, response
 time and requests pertaining to various website parts (JavaScript, CSS 
files, HTML, images, etc.).
	    			The tools generate performance scores 
based on a set or rules developed in context of Web page performance and
 user priorities. The principles include resource caching, client-server
 round-trip times, data download and upload size, and a host of rules 
impacting end-user website experience in terms of page speed.
	    			Suggestions are generated in 
anticipation of page speed improvements that should occur by 
implementing appropriate performance optimization rules. For example, if
 a large image file is served uncompressed, monitoring tools would 
recommend implementation of various measures to compress the bulky file.
 Such issues otherwise go unnoticed due to human errors or plain 
ignorance, neither of which can be truly and complete eliminated. At the
 same time, page speed monitoring tools would at least empower website 
owners to identify the issues and take appropriate steps in eradicating 
hidden website performance bottlenecks.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Testing Tutorial
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			The following test was conducted using the free Pingdom Full Page Test tool:
	    			1. Visit the ((lien: "Pingdom Full Page Test site" vers: http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/)) and conduct the test selecting various geographic locations according to the options provided, and compare the end-results.
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_1.jpg))
	    			2. Enter your website and hit the Test Now button.
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_2.jpg))
	    			3. The tool lists all downloaded files in a Waterfall Chart form, sorting it in terms of load order, load time, size, type or URL.
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_3.jpg))
	    			4. Analyze the performance of each file download by reading results against the key chart provided within the tool:
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_4.jpg))((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_5.jpg))((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_6.jpg))
	    			The Page Analysis section filters this information in three categories:
	    				
	    					- Load Time Analysis: Breakdown of time spent per domain, content type and state.
	    					- Size Analysis: File size breakdown for all content types and domains.
	    					- Request Analysis: Number of requests breakdown for all content types and domain.
	    				
	    			5. Pingdom Performance
 Grade section portrays comprehensive website performance information 
for website owners not familiar with Web development and lacking 
necessary expertise in understanding the complex Waterfall chart.
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/pingdom_7.jpg))
	    			The tool clearly identifies the 
next-best actions for website speed optimization tactics. In the sample 
test shown above, the tested website needs to combine external 
JavaScript and minimize redirects and DNS lookups to rapidly boost page 
speed. However, it’s important to understand that optimizing these 
website design elements is an ongoing and evolving process that starts 
from the ground-level of website development and implemented across all 
new pages as the website scales.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Which Tool to Pick?
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Different tools – Google’s Page Speed Insights, Pingdom and 
GTMetrix, among others – identify different issues, test different 
performance parameters and indicators in different ways, from different 
browsers and geographic locations. Performance ratings and test results 
are therefore bound to be different, and no single tool identifies every
 single performance bottleneck in website designs.
	    			However, testing across multiple tools,
 analyzing different website design elements and comparing multiple test
 results provides reasonable insights for online business owners to 
devise speed optimization strategies for their websites.

	    				How to Improve Website Speed?
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Developing a great website takes
 great work. Leading online businesses leverage industry proven 
experience, supernatural Web development skills and a killer Web hosting
 service to develop websites boasting top-notch performance figures and 
user experience. But for those who miss this starting point in their 
pursuit of speed optimized websites, employing a minimalistic approach 
in executing simple DIY page speed optimization tactics works (almost) 
well enough to patch slow websites.
	    			The knowledge of investing in the right
 set of website speed optimization solutions and services, website 
management and perhaps downright coding trickery is essential to yield 
maximum website performance. Strategic business decisions based on this 
knowledge contribute directly toward enhancing website performance that 
in turn, lead to better online sales, leads, conversions and ultimately 
business success.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/optimizing.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Optimization is the buzzword of success
 in the cyber world. Cyberspace, like the real physical world of 
planets, stars and galaxies is itself in flux – a state of continuous 
change and evolution. In fact, change is the only consistent process 
across both the real and the cyber world. Survival in these spaces 
depends on how well the inhabitants can adapt to varying resources and 
environmental circumstances.
	    			And the same goes for website owners 
competing for online business success amid varying market trends, 
changing behavior of internet visitors, advancements in cyber 
technologies at breakneck speeds under Moore’s Law and varying website 
performance standards set forth by search engine giants.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			DIY Speed Optimization
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Online business owners and webmasters adapt their websites to
 maintain optimal results under the consistent impression of change by 
improvising, and optimizing key elements of website design that make or 
break page speed.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Image Optimization
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			As a general rule of thumb, larger files take longer to 
download than smaller files. Web page download time, also known as the 
Page Load Time depends on the total size of content assets being 
downloaded from hosting servers to the requesting browser. High quality 
bulky images are the largest contributors to Web page size, degrading 
page speed and agitating visitors eagerly waiting for the web page to 
load. The following image optimization best-practices go a long way in 
reducing the negative impact of images on website speed:
	    				
	    					- Format Selection: Use JPGs when quality 
is a high priority and image modifications are not required before 
uploading it. JPGs can take limited processing and modifications before 
image quality degrades sharply. For images with icons, logos, 
illustrations, signs and text, use PNG format. Use GIFs only for small 
or simple images and avoid BMPs or TIFFs.
	    					- Proper Sizing: Save valuable bytes of 
image payload and match the dimensions (width) of your Web page 
template. Use browser resizing capabilities to make images responsive by
 setting fixed width and auto-height instructions.
	    					- Compression: Image compression should be a
 thoughtful tradeoff between image size and quality. For JPGs, a 
compression of 60-70 percent produces a good balance. For retina 
screens, increase (JPGs) image size by 150-200 percent, compress by 
30-40 percent and scale it down again as per required dimensions.
	    					- Fewer Images: Keep the number of images to an absolute minimum.
	    				
	    			(W)	WordPress Solutions:
		    			
		    				Leverage image optimization tools such as ((lien: "EWWW Image Optimizer" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/)), ((lien: "CW Image Optimizer" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/cw-image-optimizer/)), ((lien: "Lazy Load" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load/)) and ((lien: "WP Smush.it" vers: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/)) (support ended) if an external server is not used to pre-process images. Website owners can also use plugins such as ((lien: "JPEG Reducer" vers: http://www.jpegreducer.com/)) and ((lien: "Radical Image Optimization Tool (RIOT)" vers: http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/)) to optimize all existing images in bulk.
		    			
		    		
	    			And it goes without saying, use future 
expire headers for images on the website core (.htaccess for Apache 
servers) to optimize image payload with server-side preprocessing.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Optimize CSS Code and Delivery
		    	
		    
	    	
	    		
	    			Not so long ago, 30KB was considered as the ideal Web Page 
size. And that included images, content, graphics and code making the 
entire page. The popularity of CSS and JavaScript ripped apart the 
ceiling of 30KB page size in delivering enriched website user 
experience.
	    			Yet, modern websites coded in CSS are better at downloading 
content from hosting servers to requesting browsers efficiently and 
accurately. Optimization therefore isn’t all about minifying file size. 
The following best practices ensure a speed-optimized CSS delivery:
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/css.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
		    			
		    				- Shorthand Coding: Cut down the size of 
your code by using fewer declarations and operators. Fewer lines of code
 mean fewer processing cycles and efficient delivery of website files to
 requesting browsers.
		    				- Axe Browser Specific CSS Hacks: CSS is in
 danger from endlessly complicated browser specific hacks – or 
correctional declarations as they’re called – adding unnecessary weight 
to CSS script files. Speed optimized CSS code is both light and simple 
for servers to process efficiently.
		    				- Minify CSS: Almost all website speed 
monitoring tools give a common suggestion of reducing the weight of CSS 
code to improve speed. A lightweight and compact code speeds up 
downloading, parsing and execution to drastically reduce page load time.
		    				- Code Positioning: Load CSS code inside 
the &lt;head&gt; and JavaScript inside the body, as referencing CSS 
outside of this section prevents Web browsers displaying CSS content 
immediately after downloading it.
		    				- CSS Delivery Best Practices:
							- 
								
									- Use only one external CSS style sheet.
									- Do not use @import call.
									- Remove unused CSS.
									- Do not use CSS in HTML such as H1 and DIV tags.
									- Use Inline small CSS.

		    			Tools such as ((lien: "Autoptimize" vers: http://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/)), Better ((lien: "WordPress Minify" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/bwp-minify/)) and the world’s favorite, ((lien: "W3 Total Cache" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)) are some of the best tools available for minifying JavaScript and CSS.
		    		
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Minification – JavaScript, CSS, HTML
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			Indeed, speed optimization isn’t (just) about shrinking page 
size. Reducing the number of client-server requests in delivering 
website content to Web browsers is an integral part of website speed 
optimization. Webmasters can achieve this by not making too many folks 
with CSS, HTML and JavaScript requests. That is to say, optimize, minify
 and squish all unnecessary and compressible code lines.
	    			Minification is particularly important 
for inline JavaScript and external files not cached. Google recommends 
minifying all JavaScript files over 4096 bytes of size, and a shaving 
off a minimum of 25 bytes to produce any noticeable difference toward 
page load time.
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/compression.png))
	    			A rigorous approach toward designing 
speed optimized website would incorporate a strong intent on eliminating
 unnecessary bytes from the code. Utilizing all the coding space 
available, deleting extra spaces, indentation and line spaces while 
maintaining readability of the code reduces the overall size of website 
core and front-end files. And for websites already developed without 
this strategy in perspective, combining multiple server requests (for 
HTML, JavaScript and CSS) into single ones effectively slashes sizeable 
chunks from page load times.
	    			However, overindulgence in HTML 
Minification potentially leads to loss of fidelity of the website code, 
with user agents taking excessive memory cycles and CPU power in 
“guessing” the missing resources required to parse HTLM files. 
Monitoring page load performance changes in response to implementing 
each minification process individually ensures that only the unnecessary
 code and spaces are deleted.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Minification of CSS, JavaScript and 
HTML share common benefits: reduced network latency, fewer HTML 
requests, enhanced compression, faster browser downloading and 
execution, ultimately boosting page speed and yielding higher scores on 
website speed measuring tools.

	    			Minification – Content Assets and Plugins
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			Although website content and plugins add to the functionality
 of websites, the Divide and Conquer rule applies in optimizing content 
assets for maximum website performance.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Plugins – Less is More!
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			Additional website functionality with plugins comes at a 
price: performance degradation. Unfortunately, webmasters deploy a 
myriad of plugins to add attractive but often unnecessary features such 
as gravatar, profile tools, website stats and font tools – some even use
 10 different plugins for social media integration. The only benefit 
here is successfully avoiding manual coding.
	    			Many popular websites carry as much as 
80 software add-ons. Yet, the number is not entirely a concern if the 
installed plugins are developed well to avoid complex actions and 
expensive server processing.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/plugins.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Four major areas to look in selecting high quality plugins:
	    				
	    					- Does it perform complex operations?
	    					- Does it load many content assets and scripts?
	    					- Does it increase the number of database queries to each page request?
	    					- Does it perform requests to external APIs?
	    				
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			If the answer to all these questions is YES, your reaction to the plugin in question should be a huge NO!
	    			Now to the big question, how many plugins is too many?
	    			While there’s no comprehensive answer 
to this question, limitations are unique to every website and plugin. 
Many well-performing websites host over 80 plugins, until they install 
one low-quality plugin that adds half a second to page load time.
	    			Similarly, using 10 plugins for simple 
and unique tasks is much better than deploying one plugin to perform all
 of the complex tasks by itself. Exceptions include high-quality plugins
 by credible developers, such as ((lien: "W3 Cache" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)), ((lien: "Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)), ((lien: "All In One SEO Pack" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)) and the likes.

	    			Limit/Disable WordPress Revisions
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			Revision management is one of the perks that WordPress has to
 offer. The CMS automatically keeps track of the content created on the 
CMS and makes all of it available for future changes. To the server, 
this costs unnecessary processing through additional database entries 
not actually required in the first place. Controlling the number of 
revisions stored relieves the website core of useless burden.
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/wordpress_revisions.jpg))
	    			Writing the following code snippets in the wp-config.php file
 available in cPanel File Manager Code Editor helps getting round this 
issue:
	    			Disable Revisions:
					
	    				((code: define( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', false );
	    				))
	    			
					Limit Revisions:
					
						((code: define( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', 10 ); // limited to 10 revisions
						))
	    			
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Optimize Databases
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			WordPress CMS stores posts, comments, pages and other forms 
of textual and encrypted data within a single database – except for 
images and videos that are stored in the ‘wp_content’ folder instead. 
This database gets crowded over time, not only with unnecessary content 
and posts revisions, but also with garbage data.
	    			Garbage content includes:
	    				
	    					- Comments in the spam queue
	    					- Unapproved comments
	    					- Post revisions
	    					- Trashed items such as posts and pages
	    				
	    			Database optimization revolves around getting rid of garbage 
data and useless content from cluttered databases, shrinking them in 
size and making it easier for website hosting servers to fetch requested
 content efficiently, within minimum processing cycles.

	    			Compression
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			((lien: "According to Google" vers: https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/use-compression)),
 every day the cyber world sees 99 years of human years wasted due to 
uncompressed Web content. And although most of the latest Web browsers 
support content compression capabilities, not every website delivers 
compressed contents. Visitors to these bandwidth-hogging websites 
experience insanely slow interactions with Web pages. Primary reasons 
for this unfavorable (and mostly unintentional) website behavior include
 misconfigured hosting servers, Web proxies, old or buggy browsers and 
antivirus software.
	    			Uncompressed content hurts 
bandwidth-constrained users receiving the Web content in agonizingly 
lengthy page load times. Here’s the transcript of a common 
browser-server communication in delivering uncompressed content:
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/html_compression.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			
		    			Browser: Hey, GET me /HeavyWeightChampion.html!
		    			Server: On it!
		    			*server skims through the server and finds the file*
		    			Server: There you go, 250 KB of response code.
		    			Browser: Ouch!
						*end-user sweats, ultimately receiving the requested content in a few tens of seconds*.
						(Okay, client-server communication is perhaps a bit more formal and less dramatic than the above narrative.)
					
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Most of the problem lies in the way 
client-server communication goes in the HTML world. HTML files (making 
almost the entire Web content) includes several redundant code 
instances. &lt;Tags&gt;, &lt;Alts&gt;, &lt;HTML&gt; and the likes are 
all the same stuff materializing repeatedly.
	    			Google recommends the following compression tactics to deliver website content efficiently:
						
							- Minify JavaScript, HTML and CSS
							- Ensure consistency in CSS and HTML code with the following techniques:
								
									- Consistent casing – mostly lowercase.
									- Consistent quoting of HTML tag attributes.
									- Specify HTML attributes in the same order.
									- Specify CSS key-value pairs in the same order by alphabetizing them.
								
							- Enable Gzip compression. Gzip finds similar strings and code 
instances, replaces them temporarily with shorter characters. Browsers 
decompresses gzipped files, bringing them back to their original shape.
						
					A few words of caution though:
					
						
							- Do NOT gzip (already compressed) images, PDF or other binary data.
							- Gzip data only in the range of 150-1000 bytes in size. The 
speed of compression must be faster than the time taken in delivering 
the content uncompressed.
							- Do NOT compress content for old browsers.
						
					
					Not following the above recommendations actually increases file 
size and page load times due to the overhead of compression and 
decompression.

	    			Cache
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			Developers crave simplicity in website design code. Website 
code easier to create, read and maintain leads to efficient website 
development processes. This includes using the available code functions 
frequently to cut short extensive coding for specific website 
functionality.
	    			However, adding too many extraneous 
loops and unnecessary code lines increases page rendering times by a few
 milliseconds. Influx a torrent of website traffic, and the milliseconds
 compound to plunge page speed well below acceptable standards.
	    			Webmasters can reduce these response 
times by delivering cached copies of the requested content instead of 
rendering it repeatedly in response to every single user request that 
pings their server. Web cache is the mechanism of temporarily storing 
copies of Web content to satisfy subsequent user requests from the cache
 database when specific conditions are met. This process reduces the 
number of client-server round trips taken in delivering (static) website
 content to requesting browsers.
	    		
	    		
	    			((image: optimization_fichiers/cache.png))
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Website owners can enable Web caching with the following 
software add-ons and configurations when hosting service providers do 
not provide server-side caching:
	    				
	    					- ((lien: "W3 Total Cache" vers: https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)): This is the most popular performance optimization plugin and highly recommended for cache optimization.
	    					- ((lien: "Varnish Software" vers: https://www.varnish-software.com/)).
	    					- ((lien: "FastCGI Cache" vers: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html)) for Nginx and Drupal servers.
	    					- Enable browser cache.
	    				
	    			Along with static cacheable content, websites also host 
dynamic information containing unique attributes changing regularly for 
every end-user. Storing cached copies of non-reusable dynamic content 
therefore doesn’t make sense, even though rendering non-cached content 
is a painstakingly slow process.
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			Fragment Caching
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			This is the art of caching smaller elements of non-cacheable 
dynamic website content. When Web pages containing static and/or dynamic
 content are loaded, hosting servers process PHP code and query MySQL 
databases to fetch the requested content. These time-and-resource 
consuming processes are circumvented by delivering the desired output 
stored as a cached copy.
	    			Fragment caching stores the output of 
some code blocks that remain unchanged across varied versions of the 
dynamic content. When the code runs and reaches the code block cached 
for a predetermined time, the server queries and delivers the cached 
output of this code instead of executing it repeatedly, until the time 
limit reaches.
	    			The end result is a cache-optimized 
website content for maximum page speed even for ecommerce and 
membership-based websites handling intensely dynamic content.

	    			CDN is an extension of cache optimization designed to 
supercharge website performance aimed specifically at globally dispersed
 Web traffic. CDNs consist of a network of servers hosting cached copies
 of Web pages. Internet visitors requesting this information are 
directed to the nearest server within this network based on their 
geographic location.

performance boost, high availability, and page rank collectively lift 
business bottom line as explained in this ((lien: "recent Kinsta blog" vers: https://kinsta.com/blog/cdn-for-wordpress/)).

	    			Switch to Managed Hosting!
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			WordPress essentially democratized the Web by empowering 
citizens of the cyberworld to create their own blogs and launch products
 and services online with minimal investments. In general, website 
owners leverage one of the following hosting services to keep their 
websites up and running:
	    				
	    					- Free Hosting: Favorite to hobbyists.
	    					- Shared Hosting: Favorite to individuals developing online business presence at the lowest cost.
	    					- ((lien: "Dedicated or Managed Hosting" vers: https://kinsta.com/)): Favorite to serious individuals and small and midsize firms setting up online presence.
	    					- Collocated Hosting: Favorite to large enterprises or government institutions with in-house IT teams to manage websites.
	    				
	    			Among these, employing Managed Hosting for end-to-end website
 development and management services is the most cost-effective and 
productive option for maintaining an ultra-high performance website. 
Features of managed hosting services impacting page speed and website 
performance include:
	    				
	    					- Performance optimization – compression, code minification, server-side caching, etc.
	    					- Cache optimization.
	    					- Content optimization for performance – image optimization, controlling garbage data, etc.
	    					- Search Engine Optimization.
	    					- Regular software updates.
	    					- Plugin compatibility and deployment for best performance.
	    					- Database optimization.
	    					- Content Delivery Networks.
	    					- Performance testing and monitoring.
	    					- Lightweight and speed optimized servers.
	    					- Server and website configuration and maintenance to minimize client-server roundtrips.
	    					- High performance PHP runtime execution engines such as ((lien: "HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM)" vers: https://kinsta.com/blog/hhvm-and-wordpress/)).
	    				
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			WordPress is Faster in Hip Hop Virtual Machine (HHVM)
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			PHP is widely publicized for slow runtime compilation and 
execution. The sluggishness is barely recognizable for an average 
website serving a few thousand visitors simultaneously. But for online 
platforms as big as Facebook serving millions of users simultaneously, 
minute delays and inefficiency in PHP processing lead to lower page 
speed and inefficient server resource utilization.
	    			A few years ago Facebook developed a 
solution to concerns prompting excessive investments in purchasing 
supplementary servers accommodate the exploding user-base. The cunning 
solution involved executing PHP code directly instead of compiling 
operation code and interpreting it. The social media giant later used 
this experience to launch the ((lien: "Hip Hop Virtual Machine" vers: http://hhvm.com/)) (HHVM) PHP execution engine.
	    			HHVM converts PHP into bytecode, which 
is then converted into 64-bit machine code at runtime using a 
Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. This eliminates several PHP execution 
processes otherwise implemented in rendering the PHP based website 
content.
	    		
	    		
	    	
	    	
	    		
	    			HHVM Benchmarks
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			In 2008 when Facebook reached the 100 million users 
milestone, the company discovered that slow PHP execution had 
bottlenecked Facebook page speed. They realized only 20 percent of PHP 
execution time was spent in processing the native PHP code and the 
remaining 80 percent spent to interpret it. Facebook famously claimed 
HHVM deployment reduced this figure of 80 percent down to zero, boosting
 PHP execution speed by ((lien: "2 to 5 times" vers: https://medium.com/@joelgarciajr84/do-you-know-what-is-hhvm-f0e92dbb0798))!
	    			We ((lien: "did many benchmark tests" vers: https://kinsta.com/blog/real-world-wordpress-benchmarks-with-php5-5-php5-6-php-ng-and-hhvm/))
 comparing HHVM and the latest builds of PHP-FPM, including the Next 
Generation (which it seems like will be included in the official PHP7 
release) codebase and HHVM came out as a clear winner.

	    			Verdict
		    	
			
	    	
	    		
	    			The performance gap between HHVM and non-HHVM WP deployment 
is evident, and that is why Kinsta offers dedicated HHVM WP Hosting 
solutions for clients operating solid and robust applications on the 
Web.
